# DESCRIPTION

This project is a Chrome Extension developed to enhance users' productivity by tracking the amount of time spent on various websites and analyzing their browsing behavior. The extension automatically classifies visited websites as either productive (e.g., educational or coding platforms) or unproductive (e.g., social media sites), allowing users to understand and reflect on their digital habits.

At its core, the extension integrates multiple components to offer a seamless user experience. A background script continuously monitors the websites accessed, while a content script collects metadata and facilitates interaction with the active tab. The popup interface offers real-time summaries of usage statistics, enabling users to quickly check their productivity status without navigating away from their current task. For a more comprehensive overview, the dashboard presents visual analytics and a detailed breakdown of time spent on each category of websites.

# The project features include:

Automatic time tracking for every visited website.

Categorization of websites into productive or unproductive.

A popup window that displays live usage data.

A full-featured dashboard with graphical reports and analytics.

A Clear Data option to reset all stored usage history.

Ability to download reports as .txt files for record-keeping or analysis.
